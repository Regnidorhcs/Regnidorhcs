I had enough. Five months into taking 20mg of "Happy Little Pills" and I could not remember what it was like to have a strong feeling. I could not remember what it felt like to be worried for someone I cared about or be excited about something I had accomplished. My mood, oscillating between indifference and disdain often resulted in emotional disphoria. I would pay to be able to feel something different.
