                    <h2>Towards Dark Matter discovery with direct, production, and indirect searches</h2>
                    <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Struct.png" alt="" /></a>
                    <p>Discovery of the nature of the Dark Matter, comprising 85% of the matter in the Universe, is internationally
                        recognised as one of the highest scientific priorities of our time. Three complementary techniques are being
                        pursued to shed light on this elusive substance. Direct searches such as the LUX and LZ experiments use highly
                        sensitive ultra-low background detectors in deep underground laboratories to search for rare interactions of
                        galactic Dark Matter in terrestrial targets. Accelerator searches attempt to recreate the conditions of the
                        early Big Bang to produce new Dark Matter particles that would leave characteristic missing energy signatures
                        or evidence of mediator particles in detectors such as ATLAS at the LHC. Indirect searches seek evidence of
                        Dark Matter annihilation decay products from galactic and extra-galactic sources using high precision
                        space-based particle detectors.</p>
                    <p> Currently, however, precisely how such signals would
                        relate to one another, and the accuracy with which robust claims of discovery of Dark Matter could be
                        claimed, is unclear. This project will explore the implications of existing results from each on the other fields to
                        constrain the parameter space for Dark Matter models, and define the phase space upon which
                        future limits or positive detections may be collectively mapped. This research is of considerable
                        significance to the field; the interrelation of results from the three search techniques must
                        be well characterised for definitive discovery of Dark Matter.</p>

                    <h3>XLZD/DARWIN R&D</h3>
                    <p> In my second postdoc at the University of Zurich I now engage with the R&D community that is thriving here. 
                        I am involved in the Xenoscope and MarmotX projects which are each testing a unique aspect of liquid xenon 
                        detectors for the next generation of experiments. I am also working on proposals to expand the R&D efforts by
                        building my own Xenon system. </p>

                    <h3>Radon tagging in LZ</h3>
                    <p> In my first postdoc at Imperial College I focused on Radon-chain decays in the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ)
                        experiment, achieving the tagging of over 60% of all Pb-214 decays. Pb-214 composes more than half
                        of all low energy events observed by LZ within the Dark Matter region of interest and is usually 
                        mitigated through material screening and costly removal systems.  </p>

                    <h3>First LZ Background measurement</h3>
                    <p> During the commissioning phase of the experiment I carried out the first background
                        measurement, while the TPC still only contained xenon gas and before construction of outer detector
                        elements were finished. My work provided the first measurement of radon backgrounds for which I had
                        to develop my own trigger and calibration methods.

                    <p>During my PhD I spent a total of seven months working at the Surface Assembly
                        Lab of the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota where I served as the labâ€™s Cleanliness
                        Monitor. I was responsible for procuring and enforcing cleanliness protocols through the assembly
                        of the main detector, often leading a team of engineers, technicians and scientist through delicate operations.
