                    <h2>Towards Dark Matter discovery with direct, production, and indirect searches</h2>
                    <a class="image fit"><img src="images/Struct.png" alt="" /></a>
                    <p>Discovery of the nature of the Dark Matter, comprising 85% of the matter in the Universe, is internationally
                        recognised as one of the highest scientific priorities of our time. Three complementary techniques are being
                        pursued to shed light on this elusive substance. Direct searches such as the LUX and LZ experiments use highly
                        sensitive ultra-low background detectors in deep underground laboratories to search for rare interactions of
                        galactic Dark Matter in terrestrial targets. Accelerator searches attempt to recreate the conditions of the
                        early Big Bang to produce new Dark Matter particles that would leave characteristic missing energy signatures
                        or evidence of mediator particles in detectors such as ATLAS at the LHC. Indirect searches seek evidence of
                        Dark Matter annihilation decay products from galactic and extra-galactic sources using high precision
                        space-based particle detectors.</p>
                    <p> Currently, however, precisely how such signals would
                        relate to one another, and the accuracy with which robust claims of discovery of Dark Matter could be
                        claimed, is unclear. This project will explore the implications of existing results from each on the other fields to
                        constrain the parameter space for Dark Matter models, and define the phase space upon which
                        future limits or positive detections may be collectively mapped. This research is of considerable
                        significance to the field; the interrelation of results from the three search techniques must
                        be well characterised for definitive discovery of Dark Matter.</p>

                    <h3>Directional Dark Matter Detection</h3>
                    <p>Through the development and implementation of particle generating algorithms the annual and daily
                        I studied the modulation effects of <sup>8</sup>B and <sup>7</sup>Be solar neutrino

                    <h3>The LZ Experiment</h3>
                    <p>The LZ detector will employ a 7-tonne liquid xenon target to search for the rare interactions
                        of these particles with ordinary atoms in the detector medium. As part of the collaboration, I
                        am working in software development in background
                        simulations and analysis.</p>
