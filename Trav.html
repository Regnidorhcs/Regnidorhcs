            <p align="justify"> I was born in the city of Limassol, Cyprus on September 1996. As the youngest of three sons, one could
                say that my upbringing was not expected to be extraordinary in any way. I soon discovered two passions that began
                shaping me into the person I am today; learning and creating. Pursuing these endeavours began
                as afternoon activities in Fine Art, and GCSE Maths and Physics. Artist Spyroulla Skordi, a mentor and
                close friend, took me under her wing as a student in sculpture. At her studio I found myself not only
                surrounded by lessons in art but also spiritually enriched through philosophy and literature
                underlining the human need to produce art. This spiritual and intellectual enrichment I treasure and I carry with
                me to this day.
                As the afternoon lessons progressed school seemed less and less interesting.
                A turning point in my education came with a decision to focus on the afternoon lessons, moving onto
                A-Levels at the age of 16 while dropping out of what had been my 2nd year of high school. A brave step
                out of line that took exaclty as much nerve as 16-year-old me had.

            </p>
            <p align="justify">University application season came
                and went and I was lucky enough to be accepted at the University of Edinburgh's Theoretical Physics
                Mphys programme. Four years in edinburgh brought me close to some of the most important people in my
                life but also introduced me to a great set of mendors. Dr Paolo Beltrame and Prof. Alex Murphy, pillar
                memebers of the Dark Matter group, accelerated my development as a physicist and researcher. Now having
                been accepted to the PhD programme at UCL I have found a new home filled equally with cosmologists and
                particle physicists. My current supervisors include Dr Cham Ghag and Dr Andrew Pontzen as first
                supervisors and Prof. Jon Butterworth as a second supervisor.</p>

            <p align="justify"> I regularly attend conferences and schools. Some highlights I would recommend are outlined below.
